    "Every year wildfires cost billions which is hardly comparable to the lives lost from wildfires, (1). Utilizing an SQL database containing information on 1.88 million wildfires nationwide we want to investigate if we are able to predict the cause of the fire by examine size and location. Why is this important? Understanding this relationship deeper can help fine tune policies designed to prevent wildfires. Once these blazes get to a certain point it gets very difficult to control them which means our best bet in protecting ourselves is making sure they never begin. If they do begin we need to have the information to implement proper evacuation procedures that covers the appropriate area, understanding these relationships could offer insight into this problem as well. \n",
